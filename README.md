Introduction

With the rapid expansion of computer networks and increasing cybersecurity threats, ensuring robust network security has become a necessity. Cyberattacks exploit system vulnerabilities, making Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) crucial for identifying and mitigating threats.

IDSs fall into two main categories:

Misuse-based detection: Recognizes known attack patterns with high accuracy.

Anomaly-based detection: Detects novel threats by identifying deviations from normal activity.

This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning techniques to:

Classify network activity as normal or an attack (binary classification).

Identify specific attack types (multiclass classification).

Implementation Details

This IDS is implemented using three machine learning algorithms:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Neural Networks (NN)

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

1. Dataset Overview (NSL-KDD)

The dataset consists of 41 features categorized as:

Basic Features: Connection attributes (e.g., duration, protocol type).

Content Features: Indicators of attack attempts (e.g., failed logins).

Traffic Features: Time-based network behavior (e.g., connection rates).

Host Features: Long-term host behavior (e.g., error rates).

Attack classes:

Normal Activity

DoS (Denial of Service)

Probe

R2L (Remote to Local)

U2R (User to Root)

2. Data Preprocessing

Feature Selection: Identifying key features per attack type.

Categorical Encoding: One-hot encoding categorical variables.

Scaling: Standardization using StandardScaler.

Class Balancing: Addressing class imbalance for better model generalization.

3. Machine Learning Models

KNN: Configured with optimal hyperparameters (n_neighbors=3).

Neural Network: Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) with three hidden layers.

LDA: Used for linear classification.

4. Model Training & Evaluation

Dataset split (80% training, 20% testing).

Performance metrics:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Attack Classes

DoS Attacks: Overwhelm network resources (e.g., SYN Flood, Smurf Attack).

Probe Attacks: Gather network information (e.g., Port Scanning, IP Sweeping).

R2L Attacks: Gain unauthorized access (e.g., password guessing, phishing).

U2R Attacks: Escalate privileges (e.g., buffer overflow, rootkits).
